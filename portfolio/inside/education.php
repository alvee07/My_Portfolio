            My school life journey was unusual. I changed three schools before attending grade II. Finally, I admitted to Dhanmondi Government Boys’ High School. One of the best thing happen in my life, when I was in school. I made my one and only friend. Now I have four friends in Canada, but before that I only counted on him. I graduated from my school in 2010. I got GPA 5 out of 5 (Grade Point Average). After that I went to my Dhaka College, it is the oldest college in Bangladesh. I graduated from my college in 2012 with GPA 4.20 out of 5. In my entire academic journey, I faced the hardest time in my college. Despite of that, I graduated with good grades, and moving on my life.

            After my college graduation, I admitted to American International University Bangladesh. I stayed there for a semester, then I moved to UK to attend Queen’s University Belfast. I admitted into International Diploma in Engineering (Electrical and Electronic Engineering). I graduated from Queen’s University Belfast in 2015. Then I came to my dreamland, Canada. I am glad that I have the opportunity to study in Dalhousie University. Currently, I am in my second year of Bachelor of Applied Computer Science. I am on a co-op program, so I hope I will get an industrial work experience next year summer. My plan is after my graduation I will work for one or two years, save some money then I will take my post-graduate degree.
