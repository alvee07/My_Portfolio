  <h3 class="margin">What Am I ?</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    My name is Alvee Hassan Akash. I am from Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a South Asian Country. I am Bangladeshi. I speak Bengali language. I love watching all kinds action movies, Bollywood romantic, comedy movies. I can also speak Hindi and Urdu. I learned them by watching movies and some friends. I have a collection of pens since childhood. I never read any book except my textbooks and Lion king. Lion king is my first book that I read when I was around 8 years old, and it is my last book ever since. In my everyday carry bag, I always keep my phone, some cards, like bank, ID, school, a pen, my oldest mechanical pencil. One thing I must say that I am using this mechanical pencil since 2005. Generally, my favourite things are quite indestructible. I still have my first phone Nokia 1202, which is still working properly. I am graduated my high school and college degree from government institutions. Then I started my University degree in Bangladesh. After first semester, I went to UK to take diploma degree. I lived one year in Belfast city, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. I studied there for a year. I took my diploma degree from INTO Queen's University Belfast. While I was at Belfast I applied Dalhousie University, and I got transfer credits. Then I moved to Halifax City. I am currently studying Applied Computer Science. I am in my second year. I also have a part time job. I live on my own since I moved in Canada. It is one of the biggest decision that I along with my parents have ever made. I do some volunteering at Halifax Central Library. While I am doing my school work, I started realizing that the more I do my homework well, the more I like technology. by doing my homework, I learned a lot of new things that I never thought I would ever know. I love developing websites. As for now, my career path goal is developing websites. After leaving UK, I also realize one more thing that I love travelling and making memoirs of it. Thatâ€™s why I bought a camera, so that I can capture my memories.
