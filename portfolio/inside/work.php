        <h3 class="margin">Azeen the beauty</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            While I was living Bangladesh, I started online business with my friend in 2012. We used to sell brooches. Our main target was to sell our brooches to all ages of women. Initially, we started selling inside the city, Dhaka. Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh. Within a month, we got responses from outside Dhaka city. Because we were running our business through a Facebook page. Facebook page was our one and only marketing source. We contacted with some local companies. They delivery small products inner country. It was very cheap, so that we added them as our business delivery partner. Then we were selling our products outside the city.
            Our investment was very low. Despite of that, we were doing great. To make brooches, we only used various kinds of ribbons and pearls, adhesive. My friend was teaching his neighbours to make these. They were our man power. We paid them well, a big percentage of the amount that we got as a profit.
            “Azeen the beauty” was our company name. We started Azeen after our college degree. We ran the business about a year. Within this time, we never faced any loss in our business. After a year, we both became very busy with out university work. My friend is studying Medical Science, and I moved to UK. Our business becomes very slow day by day. We still have the Facebook page and some of our products. We did not close Azeen.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I never worked when I was in Bangladesh. We do not have part jobs for students, so I never had any opportunity. My first job was in UK. It was South-Asian restaurant. In UK, I had to go through hard times of my life to find jobs that I can do. Restaurant jobs in UK are very hard and they do not care for their employees. That’s why I had to go around other places to get better jobs. After a year, I moved to Canada and got a sessional job at OLD NAVY in 2015. While I was working at OLD NAVY, I got another opportunity at WINNERS. I accepted the offer letter. I worked there almost 16 months. I also worked full time at Tim Hortons in summer 2016, and I still have that job. It’s been a year now, I am working at Tim Hortons, Canada’s top ranked chain restaurant.

        <h3 class="margin">Volunteering Experiences</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This is my life’s first volunteering experience. I presented a lecture at Halifax Central Library about Static Website creation. In my lecture, I taught them how to make simple websites, where students can learn about websites, where they can get resources, and many other important topics related to website creation. There were seven students. Firstly, I had to teach them the core modules that they need to know to start. It was bit of combination of two languages. After my presentation, I gave them some cheat sheets, so that they could have a look. It was more than three hours at the library. I enjoyed my first volunteering work, and I learned even more than what I taught them. Thanks to my friend, Sanjaya Raj, he inspired me to do some excellent jobs.
