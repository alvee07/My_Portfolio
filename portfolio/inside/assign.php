        <h3 class="margin">AC to DC Current</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This was my final semester group at Queen’s University Belfast. We had to make a circuit which takes AC electrical current and gives us DC electrical current. Revised circuit of AC (alternating current) voltage converting to DC (direct current) voltage was defined here. After doing double preparation and workings on PCB board, we got the acceptable results at least. There was something problem in our ELVISII board too so that, we could not hit our target. Besides, we learnt something from the task that how big power industries work. In future, we will work on PCB board too. In this task, we learnt how to make PCB board and its fabrications, uses of Ultiboard etc.

    <h3 class="margin">Get Your Hands Dirty</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        I presented a lecture at Halifax Central Library about Static Website creation, and a few times I volunteered as a mentor. In my lecture, I taught them how to make simple websites, where students can learn about websites, where they can get resources, and many other important topics related to website creation.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        It helped me to defeat my language barrier, it also increased my confidence in speaking and professional skills. It helped to improve my other professional skills. It boosts up my confidence to the next level. Volunteering helps me to talk to people. I become more social after that. Working as a volunteer is also beneficial for my career. It has a great impact on resume. The more I work for community, the more I get to know about the opportunity in every sector of my study.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Now I regularly do some volunteering works whenever I can manage my schedule. It makes me happy. I would have never realized that volunteering is such an amazing feeling if I did not do it.

        Learning narrative assignment, I mentioned that how much I have changed since I stepped in Canada. My lifestyle has changed drastically. My foremost learning moment was when I had to come UK and Canada for higher education. How I separated from my family, relatives, and friend. How I am surviving here. It is totally new to me.

    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Second turning point was when I did my first volunteering. It changes my point of view in many different things. I learnt so many so many things thought-out this volunteering journey.

    <p style="text-align: justify">
        It is my first website from scratch. It was for INFX 1606 course final project. I learnt a lot from this course, and I really have a lot of fun. It was the first computer science course in my entire two years of university that I enjoyed most.

    <p style="text-align: justify">
        It is winter 2017 INFX Advanced assignment. It is a “CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”. Like Facebook, it is very simple CMS (content management system). There is an Admin of the system, some members, and lots of users. In this CMS, I am the admin, there are some authors who can post into my website and users can comments on those posts. Users can not post anything. Authors can delete comments if they do not like it. Admin can do everything in this site. They can delete users, authors whatever they want.
